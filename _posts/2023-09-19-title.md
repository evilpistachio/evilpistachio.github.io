# OSINT Exercise #006 Writeup

## This is a walkthrough of completing Sofia Santos (gralhix.com) OSINT exercise

Task briefing:

On January 19, 2023, a journalist with almost 140k followers on Twitter shared an image of a destroyed vehicle amidst a large cloud of smoke and fire. The tweet said: “BREAKING: TTP carried out a suicide attack on a police post in Khyber city of Pakistan that killed three Pakistani police officers.“

The photo is not of the event described by the journalist.

1. The first thing I'm going to do is a reverse image search with Google Images - Google Lens. The image could certainly be depicting a suicide car bomb attack, there is not much information in the photo regarding the country or area the photo was taken.

- I take a screenshot of the entire picture including the social media post. I also save the image on its own. 

I upload the standalone image and Google produced no results.

I get the same results when searching the image including the social media post.

<br>
<br>

2. I move onto a different image search, tineye.com. 

I upload again the standalone image of the burning car and this time receive many matches. There 389 results, leading me to believe this social media post is definitely not using a picture from the event being reported on.

<br>
<br>
<br>

3. Now it's time to sort through the matches to try and find the actual source. 

The first image result states that the image was taken from an event on 27 August 2006, in Baghdad, Iraq. So I move to Google.com and search *"BAGHDAD, IRAQ - 27 August 2006 vehicle bomb"* 

[title](https://www.alamy.com/baghdad-iraq-27-august-2006-a-vehicle-born-improvised-explosive-devise-or-car-bomb-after-exploding-on-a-street-outside-of-the-al-sabah-newspape-image491795068.html?irclickid=24i2aO1AmxyPR0M1-9VwDS10UkFU6fT3NzYR3s0&utm_source=77643&utm_campaign=Shop%20Royalty%20Free%20at%20Alamy&utm_medium=impact&irgwc=1)

The first result is from the US Department of Defense - a reliable source for such events. 
[title](https://www.defense.gov/Multimedia/Photos/igphoto/2001188842/)

This page confirms that a "Vehicle Born Improvised Explosive Devise" was used on August 27th, 2006 in Baghdad Iraq. It destroyed more than 20 cars and wounded and killed many people. 

While it can be confirmed that an attack happened on this date and location, and that cars were destroyed, I still would like the find more evidence of this photo being from this specific attack.

4. I go back to google and search the title included with the search result from tineye.com (which took me to alamy.com)

*"A 'Vehicle Born Improvised Explosive Devise' or car bomb after exploding on a street outside of the Al Sabah newspaper office in the Waziryia district of Baghdad, Iraq."*

This search leads me to a wikipedia page with the same title and a different image.

The image is sourced from the US Navy, with a link to their photo gallery. Unfortunately, the link is broken. I use the image search on the US Navy website to look for photos on the date of 08/27/2006 and get nothing. I then tried to search photos for the entire year of 2006 and again, nothing. 
<br>
<br>
<br>

5. In searching through the rest of the links on tineye.com, I come across a very similar wikimedia page as before, except the photo matches the prompt. 

[title](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:WaziriyaAutobombeIrak.jpg)

The site claims to have the metadata of the image, that it was taken on August 27th, 2006. This page also claims the source is the US Navy, taken by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Eli J. Medellin. Unfortunately, the source link is broken on this page too. 

Ultimately, this is enough to show that the image from the post is definitely not from the attack in Pakistan in 2019 and is actually from 2006 in Baghdad, Iraq.
