## ***Welcome to my technology blog!***

**This is my daily learning journal in the realms of software, cybersecurity, and cloud computing.**

Here you will find posts about what I'm currently studying, 
serving as a digital notebook while providing practical knowledge about these topics. 

Additionally, I will include articles of some projects I have completed, the process, the outcomes, and what they taught me.
