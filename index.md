***Welcome to my technology blog!*
Where I share my journey and discoveries in the fascinating realms of software, cybersecurity, and cloud computing.**

Here you will find daily posts about what I'm currently studying, 
acting as a digital notebook while providing practical knowledge about these topics. 

Additionally, I will include articles of some projects I have completed, the process, the outcomes, and what they taught me.
