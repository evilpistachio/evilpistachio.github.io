### An Overview for Deploying a Wordpress Site with Terraform and AWS Lightsail
## Infrastructure as Code enables us to automate and provision resources consistently and effeciently 

# In the Beginning
Having played around with Wordpress hesistantly in the past, I was excited when a friend asked me to create their website using it. They had been burned
by a website development service and were just looking to get something up to start posting content. Can you think of a more flattering invitation to a 
project than "The professional I hired didn't even produce a visitable site, so you couldn't possibly give me anything worse than them!"? I am no web developer 
or UX designer, but I accepted the challenge to help a friend in need and learn more about this very popular toolset. With the help of the endless wealth of 
knowledge that is Youtube and my best friend Google I began the process.

To start designing the site with Wordpress, I downloaded an application called Local. Local allows you to build and design the site hosted on your computer, 
so you don't need to worry about setting up and paying for hosting at first. It includes some nice features and even has an option to produce a live link
to your site so you can show someone over the internet how the site is progressing. I am not going to go into the details of actually building the site.
I will however include the link to the video I watched that helped me get a better understanding of how Wordpress works and how to make your site look
professional. 


# It's Time to Terraform
Having studied in a cloud computing program in university, I am quite familiar with deploying and setting up cloud resources and infrastructure. AWS is my 
provider of choice but I have dabbled with Azure and Digital Ocean as well and these platforms are very similar. Provisioning scalable, secure environments 
in the cloud becomes even easier with the management approach called Infrastructure as Code (IaC). IaC invovles creating configuration files describing the 
type of resources we want, the network environment they should exist in, and the type of programs and software we might want them to run. The tool I chose
to use to automate this wordpress deployment is Terraform, an IaC tool developed by HashiCorp. 

You'll need to integrate and configure your AWS account via the AWS Toolkit with the code editor of your choice, I use VS Code. You will also need to download 
and add the Terraform extension. After creating a folder for the project and running the 'terraform init' command to ensure all is well, it's time to begin coding.

Since this is more of an overview than an actual tutorial, I will simply be touching on a few important aspects of the terraform configuration. I will include a
link to the full project on my github. 

Files in Terraform are saved with the .tf extension and the first file you'll likely work on is main.tf. The very beginning of main.tf includes the provider block.
This is where we tell Terraform which platform/provider to interact with so that the proper plugins and necessary configuration options for authentication are
used so we are able to connect to our chosen platform. 

```terraform 
  terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "4.14.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = var.region
}
```
